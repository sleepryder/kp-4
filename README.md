🧠 CONCEPT:
This website simulates a memory fragment — an immersive, interactive experience based on an ambiguous photograph found online.
It functions like a pseudo-archival interface.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎭 ARTISTIC APPROACH:
The idea was to investigate the aesthetics of memory, digital unreliability, lost data, and the haunting familiarity of anonymous archives.
The image of the room — which serves as the core of the experience — was one of the first results for “Soviet room” on Google. Its strange, almost uncanny appearance — with obvious Photoshop edits, mismatched furniture, and artificial lighting — struck me as both absurd and poetic. I decided to use it as a stage for exploring themes of memory, displacement, and the absence of home. The interaction is deliberately minimal, encouraging users to wander through this frozen fragment, to project their own feelings, and to treat the environment like a fractured memory interface.

🧩 FUNCTIONALITY:

🌄 Seasonal overlays:
  A dropdown allows users to change the "season" (spring, summer, autumn, winter).
  Each season includes:
    • canvas-based particle effects (e.g. petals, fireflies, snow, raindrops),
    • custom ambient sound,
    • visual filters (e.g. blur, noise, hue shift).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Interactive hotspots:
  Invisible zones placed over the background image reveal short phrases when hovered.
  These fragments hint at personal, emotional, or fictional narratives—like scraps of memory resurfacing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 Day/Night mode:
  A toggle button alters the site’s lighting using CSS filters (brightness, contrast),
  evoking time shifts, parallel realities, or mental states.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎧 Ambient audio layers:
  A low hum plays by default, combined with seasonal tracks that reinforce the emotional and environmental tone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📼 Pseudo-UI player:
  A stylized player element sits in the corner—non-functional, retro, suggestive of an abandoned media interface.
  It symbolizes access to memory as media.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ℹ️ Conceptual hint:
  A small corner tooltip explains the premise of the site, blending in-universe fiction with meta-commentary.

🧪 TECH STACK:
- HTML5 + CSS for layout, style, and transitions
- Vanilla JavaScript (modular) for all interactivity
- Canvas API for animated seasonal effects
- Audio elements for spatial and temporal immersion
- No frameworks or libraries — everything is built from scratch
